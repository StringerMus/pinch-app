# Pinch App

## Introduction

Pinch app is the front end developed using ReactJS, is a host that allows users list items they have available for others to borrow, interested users can search for items they need to contact the owner to arrange fee, duration of rent and pick-up/drop-off. Pinch API serves as the backend for the Pinch app developed using Django Rest Framework. 

This allows users to create and view profiles and posts listings, comments, likes, have edit and delete functions to make the service possible for users.

It solves the problem of not having to purchase items that are expensive, only needed for one time use or items that even difficult to acquire or store as after use borrowers give the item back and a fraction of a fee can be charged instead of paying full price.
